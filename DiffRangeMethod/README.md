# Radio Emission Source Localization Using TDOA Method

## Project Description

This project implements the Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) method to determine the coordinates of a radio emission source using data from three measurement stations.  
The solution includes:

1. Mathematical model of the equation system  
2. Numerical solution of nonlinear equations  
3. Results visualization  

## Requirements

To run this program you need:  
-- MATLAB R2018b or newer  
-- Optimization Toolbox
