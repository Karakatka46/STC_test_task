# LCG Parameter Finder

## Description
This C++ program implements a solver for Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) parameters. Given a sequence of 4 numbers generated by an LCG, it can:  

-- Determine the modulus (m), multiplier (a), and increment (c) parameters  
-- Predict the next number in the sequence  
-- Validate whether a sequence could be generated by an LCG  

## How It Works
1. Takes 4 consecutive numbers from an LCG sequence as input  
2. Searches for valid parameters by:  
   -- Calculating element differences  
   -- Solving for multiplier (a) using modular inverses  
   -- Deriving increment (c)  
   -- Verifying against full sequence  
3. Outputs found parameters and next predicted number  

## Usage
```bash
# Compile
g++ alg_LCG_v1.cpp -o alg_LCG_v1 -std=c++23

# Run
./lc_solver
# Enter 4 numbers when prompted (space-separated)
