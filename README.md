# Signal Processing Algorithms Project

This repository contains implementations of three distinct signal processing algorithms:  

1. Linear Congruential Generator (LCG)  
2. Karplus-Strong Frequency Synthesizer  
3. Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) Coordinate Calculation  

Each task includes executable files, detailed documentation, and its own `README.md` with comprehensive descriptions.
